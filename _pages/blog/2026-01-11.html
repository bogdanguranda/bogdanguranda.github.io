<h2>Free Iran! From the Ocean to the Sea!</h2>

<p>
    Huuuge blunder if the USA (and the free world) doesn't help the people of Iran now.
</p>
<p>
    Maduro's capture was, frankly, a masterpiece, but a free Iran would be net benefit not only to the region, but to
    the
    whole world, including Ukraine (via stopping Iranian drones exports).
</p>
<p>
    The walls are closing in on Putin already, increased oil production from Venezuela means lower prices, means less
    revenue for tiny Vlad's war machine.
</p>
<p>
    Any freedom loving people should be standing behind the USA and president Trump.
</p>

<p>
    Mr. President, I heard there's some really nice real estate in Iran for you.
    Don't be too long, the people of Iran are waiting.

<p>
    And all of you "progressives" supporting 2 dictators, because you have TDS, have nothing to do with progress.
</p>
<p>
    Free Iran! From the Ocean to the Sea!
