<h2>Let's start with me complaining about something (again), shall we?</h2>

<p>שלום, חברים שלי! Hello (lit. "peace"), my friends!</p>

<p>You see the exclamation mark before the "Hello"? If you're a Hebrew lover, much respect to you, you most likely know
    what I'm about to say. If not, then you might think it's a stupid mistake, well yes, but it's not mine, ok?! It's a
    common problem with writing on the Internet or apps in Hebrew, or mixed with Hebrew, it gets confused about where to
    put the punctuations as Hebrew is written from right to left.</p>

<h2>Volunteering in a soup kitchen</h2>

<p>Yes, I'm volunteering in Israel (Tel-Aviv) in a soup kitchen! Serving free food to people in need. How about that?!
    I'm a software engineer, makes total sense. Anyway, let's get in to it!</p>

<p>The organisation is called Lasova, which means something in Hebrew, but apparently even Israelis can't tell what
    (Israelis please help!). You can find more info about the organisation here: <a
        href="https://www.lasova.org.il/">https://www.lasova.org.il/</a> It has just been my first day, and I had a good
    experience. There's a hard part, especially if you don't know Hebrew, because people ask you things in Hebrew, but
    still, they don't ask complicated things, so it's still manageable. Also standing 4 hours on my feet and moving
    around almost all the time was a bit tiring for the first day. I'm sure some of you do harder stuff, so not gonna
    complain. But hey, let's look at the up side also! I get to learn some Hebrew and practice it live in real
    situations. And I get the change to do a good deed helping people, in Israel, which you might want to try, to see
    how rewarding it is, even if it's not easy (or especially?).</p>

<p>There are other good volunteering opportunities, for example, there's Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency
    medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service. The name means"Red Star of David"). I have 2 flatmates that are
    doing this, my roommate is one of them and he's actually on a night shift right now, 11 PM - 7 AM. Now I've scared
    you!</p>

<h2>Ulpan Bayit</h2>

<p>Who the hell is Ulpan (אולפן)? It's not a he/she guys and gals, it is a Hebrew word meaning "studio", "teaching", or
    "instruction". Bayit (בית) is the name of this Ulpan, which means "home".</p>

<p>You got the idea, right? It's a Hebrew language school. It's a unique thing to Israel as far as I can tell and it
    makes sense as it was needed in order to teach Jewish immigrants (and still needed) from around the globe, the
    Hebrew language, while making Aliyah (Jews returning to their homeland, Israel). So, besides other things, I've
    joined this Ulpan to learn Hebrew, and I can tell you that the atmosphere here is really like at home! If you're
    planning to stay for a longer period in Israel, I believe this is a really useful thing to do as it helps you
    navigate daily life better.</p>

<h2>Enjoying Israel...</h2>

<p>There's a lot of ways one can enjoy Israel, and I'm far from trying all of them, yet... But, here's a very few places
    to visit, that I want to share with you, mostly things that I have photos of... (I'm still bad about doing lots of
    photos, many times it happens that I just forget to do any, which we can argue is both good and bad).</p>

<p>A good place to visit while in Tel-Aviv, is the city of Yafo. You might see sometimes that Tel-Aviv is called Tel
    Aviv - Yafo. Yes, that Yafo, they are united, but were 2 separate cities when Tel-Aviv was founded in 1909.
    Actually, 66 Jewish families from Yafo went to the desert to start building what is today Tel-Aviv. Cool, huh?!</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center; color:#8b949e; font-style:italic; margin-top:1rem;">
    Yafo (Jaffa) — one of the oldest ports in the world, just south of Tel Aviv
</p>

<p>It's one of the most ancient ports recorded in history, dating back to ~4000 years ago, and it is believed to be the
    place where Jonah had set sail, for those of you who know the story from the Tanakh. It's also home to many Arabs,
    so it's a different experience than Tel-Aviv.</p>

<p>Another place I've found really beautiful it's the old port of Tel-Aviv, even though there was a storm coming, so
    obviously the place was pretty much empty. But I think that it must be a really amazing place with some vibrant
    action going on. There's also a lot of restaurants there and the view is great.</p>

<p>You might not know, but from a flora point of view Israel is not as green as most European countries for example, it
    resembles Greece or Southern Italy more, I think. That means that when you find a park like this you're going to
    love it!</p>

<p>One more important thing... רבותי ("rabotai" = gentlemen), if you love Israel, let me know what do you love most
    about Israel in the comments section! Also let me know if you liked this post or not. Take care!</p>

<p>להתראות!</p>
