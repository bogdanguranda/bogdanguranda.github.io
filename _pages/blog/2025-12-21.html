<h2>Does Australia need even more gun laws?</h2>

<p>Let's think about it.</p>

<p>
    You've already implemented stricter gun laws after that despicable massacre in 1996. It was supposed to stop gun
    violence, right? It looked like it did, until it didn't. So, what happened?
</p>

<p>
    But you're going to say to me "yes but those laws helped". Well, arguably not, since you've just experienced another
    massacre, but I'll play along and say they might have "helped", fine, keep them, but you are never going to ban guns
    entirely, it's going to be cosmetic, you'll say less guns per person, but those men that were stopped by the
    counter-terrorism unit coming from Victoria where 7! How much carnage if they would have had 7 guns, legally?
</p>

<p>
    Also, what makes you think that a criminal, who, by definition is breaking the law, is going to respect one more
    law?
    You
    think a person who's willing to die, cares about your extra law?
</p>

<p>
    Let's take France for example, which has particularly strict gun laws, even by European standards, yet it
    experienced
    the Bataclan Islamic terrorist mass-shooting in 2015 that killed 80! I guess they didn't check the latest law
    updates?
</p>

<p>
    But you're not convinced, so let's get really pragmatic, the Islamic terrorist attack in Nice in 2016 killed 86
    people
    (!!) and injured 458 others (!!!), with, guns? NO! A TRUCK!
    Are you ready to restrict or ban trucks, too? Because trucks are even deadlier than guns! Cars too?!
</p>

<p>
    The problem is not the guns, trucks, cars, machetes, kitchen knives, cricket bats, rocks or basically anything that
    can
    kill.
    The problem is the Islamic ideology that possess the people who commit those acts and the fact
    that you've imported and keep importing those people. People who are not going to assimilate in your society, people
    who despise your culture, religion and values, let alone embrace them.
</p>

<p>
    Your fight, your laws, should be directed at the Islamic ideology that created this and how to stop more of these
    people from coming in.
    And, oh boy, I don't even want to think about what are you going to do with those already imported, good
    luck, they have citizenship rights and an army of human rights activists and lawyers because they are in a civilised
    country. But, anything that falls short of addressing this, is a confused attempt from politicians to show the
    public that they are doing something to fix the problem, nonsense.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, if this is the only response, there will be more Islamic terrorist attacks in Australia. Why? Because
    you're bringing people in from places that are rampant with Islamic ideology, without a proper
    mechanism of
    separating the wheat from the chaff, it's just a matter of time, look at Europe, it's become the norm.
</p>

<p>
    Islam is plagued by violence and hate, and yes, there are good Muslims, yes God bless Ahmed, the
    hero, don't worry, I'm not an idiot, but maybe you should listen to the good Muslims, you have your own Australian
    citizen, Imam Mohammad Tawhidi, or check on FDD's respectable Hussain Abdul-Hussain who have more knowledge than me
    or you about the Muslim world, you should ask them what they think of the Muslim Brotherhood and the fact that
    Australia hasn't designated it as a terrorist organisation, you should ask them what they think about recognising
    Palestine and if there's a genocide in Gaza, you should ask them questions about Islam and it's mainstream in
    Australia.
</p>

<p>
    You're going to say to me "Islam is not plagued by violence and hate". Is that so? You have your own The
    Australian
    National Imams Council (ANIC) who's Grand Mufti (the leader) said in February 2015 that the Australian Government
    should not ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, saying the group is "actually pro-freedom of speech", when a simple search will tell
    you
    that it "is an international pan-Islamist and Islamic fundamentalist political organisation whose stated aim is the
    re-establishment of the Islamic caliphate to unite the Muslim community and implement sharia globally."
    Got it? This is Australia's primary national body for Islamic religious leadership with over 300 registered member
    imams, supposed to be the dominant Islamic clerical authority in Australia, you get it?! It's rampant! Rampant!
</p>

<p>
    Maybe you should look at the UAE, they, a Muslim country, have already designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a
    terrorist organisation 12 years ago and you still haven't!
    Check their policies, citizenship, border, etc. because they have virtually no terrorism, unlike most Islamic
    countries.
</p>

<p>
    I'm talking about mainstream Islam, I'm not talking about individual Muslims, I'm talking about ideologies, not
    people.
    Men don't possess ideas, ideas possess men (said someone wise, not me).
</p>

<p>
    I haven't even touched the theology section. I'll give you a quick one.
    If you're a Christian, you're most likely a trinitarian (98-99% of Christians are), which means you've committed one
    of the gravest sins in
    Islam,
    because it's a form of "shirk", associating partners with God; this is how your lovely neighbour Muhammad will look
    at you, at best as a lost soul that should convert to Islam, at worst as a blasphemer... and for blasphemy there's
    even the death penalty.
</p>

<p>
    Islam might be capable of reforming, I don't know and I don't care. I'm not willing to sacrifice our people, our
    culture, our faith and civilisation to find out. I've seen the opposite of reformation happening in the last 3
    years, so forgive me if I'm not optimistic about it.
</p>

<p>
    Australia doesn't have a gun problem, it has an uncomfortable Islam problem, just like the majority of the West.
