<h2>Happy Purim from Tel Aviv!</h2>

<p>חג פורים שמח!</p>

<p>(hag Purim sameah)</p>

<p>(Happy Purim holiday!)</p>

<p><em>Note: the "h" in "hag" and "sameah" is not an English "h" which is a sound created in the mouth, but rather
        guttural, meaning, created in the back of the throat.</em></p>

<h2>Short reflections on complaining</h2>

<p>Did you complain about something today?</p>

<p>I thought about not complaining for the first time in these blog post series! You know, no one really cares about our
    complaining, right? Why waste the energy?</p>

<p>BUT... but, but, but, but, but... I just want to SHARE, something that happened to me, it's so relevant you're going
    to be amazed. After the Purim evening when there was a party on the rooftop of the building where I live, the
    Internet is not working anymore, so I'm using my mobile data now, you should appreciate!</p>

<p>Why don't you call someone to fix it, smart ass?! Na-a-aaaa, there's no one responding today, it's Shabbat guys,
    remember? Yeah, even in Tel-Aviv.</p>

<h2>Cookieeeeees?!</h2>

<p>If this doesn't get you hooked... then... it means you probably just ate.</p>

</figure>

<p>OK, so these aren't some random cookies, but are actually specifically made for Purim. They are called "hamentashen"
    (Haman's pockets, in Yiddish) and אוזני המן (Oznei Haman = Haman's ears, in Hebrew). They are traditionally filled
    with poppy seed, but nowadays can be filled with raspberry, apricot and who knows what. So, who's this guy, Haman?
</p>

<h2>The story of Purim</h2>

<p>The story of Purim is described in the Tanakh (Jewish Scriptures) in the Book of Esther or מגילת אסתר (Megillat
    Esther = Scroll of Esther) in Hebrew. Now I've just added another name which I didn't explain, so why not add 2
    more: Ahasuerus, the king of Persia (presumed to be Xerxes I or Artaxerxes I of Persia) and last but not least,
    Esther's uncle Mr. Mordechai. That's it! The plot is simple, like in your favourite super-heroes movie.</p>

<p>There's the villain, Haman, he's going to do some terrible things. And there's also the un-experienced super-hero,
    Esther, who's got an invaluable power and get's to know the villain before things get crazy. Then there's the
    neutral character, at first at least, but powerful, who gets corrupted by the evil forces, that would be king
    Ahasuerus,</p>

</figure>

<p>and last, but not least, the veteran super-hero, who will recruit the un-experience one and come up with a plan to
    defeat the evil forces; and that my friends is, the legend himself, uncle Mordechai.</p>

</figure>

<p>Got it, right? Good.</p>

<p>Now, at stake is עם ישראל (am Israel = nation of Israel), the plan is to use Esther's influence as the new queen, to
    reverse the evil decree that Haman pushed by using the influence he has over the king. I don't want to go in to
    details, but after plenty of parties that Ester throws, they are able to pull off the incredible plan and save their
    people! Hurray! That means another party, right?! Yes! More parties!</p>

<h2>Purim in Tel-Aviv</h2>

<p>So... now I get to my next point which is: Purim is the happiest holiday of the Jewish people! And in that spirit,
    Jews worldwide wear masks, dress up in costumes, and party..., but in Tel-Aviv they party... and party... and
    party... and the amount of costumes is astonishing.</p>

<p>What's happening in this city these days is just incredible, people just dress up as anything... party every night
    and it doesn't stop after 1 day, it's still lasting as we speak and it's been almost 3 days already.</p>

<p>There were some really good costumes I liked, so here's some that I actually got on camera *(spoiler: the best one is
    at the end so keep reading, don't cheat!!).*</p>

<p>But first, let me show you how the city was looking before Purim.</p>

<p>You're starting to see something, isn't it? DC/Marvel changed our society for ever (or at least for a while). You can
    clap if you're a DC/Marvel fan, yey. You see, I'm just considering them as the same thing, I don't really care, you
    can cry now.</p>

<p>Alright, back to our sheep (*wink, wink*).</p>
