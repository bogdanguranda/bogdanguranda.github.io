excerpt: Why Israel? Why 3 months? Why move at all? A story of meaning, border drama, and finding hope in Tel Aviv.

<h2>Why? Why? Why?</h2>

<p>I think, we humans, ask this question, directly, indirectly or unconsciously to others or to ourselves, in a lot of
    situations, e.g. "Why did you do this?" or "Why did she do that?" or "Why didn't they do the other thing?" or "Why
    should I do it?" or maybe even "Why live at all?", and we want to understand "the why" of everything. And that's
    great, that's how our nature is, we live be finding meaning in what we do, otherwise we can't get any energy to do
    something at all or move past pain. So then, you would ask, why move to Israel for 3 months? Why Israel? Why 3
    months? Why move at all? For the sake of pleasant reading and context, let me show you a glimpse of Tel-Aviv,
    Israel.</p>

<p>Coming back to our question, I'm trying to be as honest as possible, and the answer is not about going on a vacation
    only, or about helping people (because I'm going to do part time volunteering in a kitchen soup), but it's actually
    about finding my meaning/mission in this world. "So vague, Bogdan" you want to say. I know, but it's the essence
    because I don't want to elaborate more on this. "Great! You must be living your dream then!" you might say. Let's
    talk about that...</p>

<h2>How I got in trouble in Israel...</h2>

<p>You didn't expected that, didn't you? Let's get going.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of Israel and considered volunteering you might have heard of Masa (Hebrew for "journey"). It's a
    program created and financed by the State of Israel, that creates programs and gives sponsorship for young Jews
    around the globe to come and experience Israel. The majority of youngsters that do this, choose to make Aliyah
    (literally "immigration") afterwards at some point, thus becoming Israeli citizens. If you're not Jewish, but you
    still want to come, you might get a chance, but you'll have to pay all the costs of the program (and Israel is not
    cheap, especially Tel-Aviv). That's what I did. Now... I arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport, outside of Tel-Aviv. I'm
    sorry I didn't take any pictures. I get to the passport control after waiting in a queue for about 25 minutes, and
    before I actually get there, I see the people that went before me, that they are having fun with the man in charge
    over there. I approach, I give my passport, I say I'm coming from Cluj, Romania, and the man asks:</p>
    
<p>- Ce e Universitatea? (Romanian for "What is the University?")</p>

<p>I'm just confused at this point.</p>
    
<p>- Universitatea mea? ("My University?") He stares at me with a frowned face.</p>
    
<p>- Are you from Cluj?</p>

<p>- Yes, I reply.</p>
    
<p>- What football team is in Cluj? </p>

<p>- CFR Cluj.</p>

<p>- On the big stadium!</p>

<p>- Ah... U-Cluj.</p>

<p>- UNIVERSITATEA! He replies.</p> 

<p>Ok, now I'm anxious already. And then he asks me how long I want to stay
    and I say 3 months. Now this is where things get interesting... He then asks me if I'm Jewish? I say NO. Well, now
    that's suspicious for them. Then the discussion goes on and I'm making it shorter, but in the end he suggests to me
    that I'm actually having a girlfriend in Israel and that's why I come. Jesus... Now I'm really stressed, I'm
    starting to panic. You're getting what's going to happen, right? TO THE RANCH! I mean, to the office for more
    intense questioning. Yes, exactly. Now, I won't go in to more details, but after some more 20 minutes of waiting and
    another 20 minutes of questioning, calling other people, arguing, stress, they let me enter Eretz Israel. When you
    thought it's all over, I got problems getting to my apartment and knocked to the wrong door for 30 minutes and had
    no Internet or SIM to call anyone. And that's not all, for a reason I won't explain now, I couldn't sleep well that
    night. Yey!</p>

<p>*Disclaimer: I don't want to complain about Israeli border security, because they have to deal with a lot of people
    that want to harm Jews and the State of Israel, and there's plenty of examples for that. It was just not pleasant
    and bad management from the organisation I signed up for because of not getting me a proper visa in advance. And
    that's my fault I didn't persuade them enough to do so.*</p>

<h2>A new hope!</h2>

<p>All of this took the wind out of my sails, but... The next morning, I got outside and started to get my shit
    together.</p>

<p>I was still having an internal struggle and couldn't enjoy the day well, but I tried to do it and even went to a
    synagogue in the evening (Tel Aviv International Synagogue) and had the chance to see and hear live the Israeli
    Justice Minister, Ayelet Shaked, giving a speech!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my story. Let me know if you liked it or not, and what similar experiences you had. I would love
    to hear from you!</p>

<p>להתראות! ("lehitraot" = till we see again)</p>
